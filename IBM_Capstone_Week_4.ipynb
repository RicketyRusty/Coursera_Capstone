        "  New York and Toronto are some of the most popular cities in the world. People migrate to other places in search of better opportunities and standards of living. A large number of people immigrate to these cities every year. Some people move from Toronto to new york and vice versa. A person moving from one city to another prefers to stay in a similar locality in the new place with similar facilities and venues in the locality, which helps to accommodate to the new place easily and faster. It also makes life easier. The given project compares different localities and presents the localities in both the cities which are similar in terms of venues and facilities available like shops, coffee shops, transportation, services, etc.\n",
